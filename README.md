PAIN ADDRESSED

• Manually transcribing audio or video footage can take a lot of time,
especially when there is a extensive recordings, which is time
consuming process. 

• Difficulty in extracting important details from long audio or video
transcripts might be difficult to sift through the most crucial
information, which can result in information overload.

• Language barriers, can be challenging to understand the critical
information stated by the non-native speaker, especially if the speaker
has spoken fast or with different accent.

• Moreover, when we want revise some key concepts from video or
audio lectures it very hard to go back and forth to the whole lengthy
video, which is time consuming process.

SOLUTION

• To encounter the problems discussed, we propose a web application which
generates a summarized version of notes in their desired language by
taking audio/video lectures as an input using speech to text API’s and NLP
libraries.

• By generating the summary from transcript users get a accurate and quick
understanding about the content of the topic in a shorter time and reduce
accent problems.

• Language barrier can be defeated by using Google Translator API’s and we
can understand the whole concept in a easy way with the help of simple
summary which is in their desired language.

• With our application, students will be able to gain the insights from the
lectures in easy manner and understandable format and It will help them
in preparation of any kind of examination.

CONCEPT and JUSTIFICATION

• By integrating natural language processing (NLP) and with APIs, students can receive tailored notes 
in the form the transcript, obtained from the audio/video lectures.

• After receiving the output from the API, summarized text will be obtained with the help of Python 
NLP libraries and this can be change as per our desired language by Google Translator API’s.
